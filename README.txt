Just a short little clicker game I made while experimenting with Tk in python.

- All you should need to do is run the clicker.py script and shabam! You're having the time of your life baby.
- Always a good idea to check over the .py script to make sure im not injecting malware into your system. (I'm not, it'd be funny if I did but I'm not. Just good practice to check)
- Have fun! Finish value set at 10,000 but you can definitely modify it if you want to suffer more or less.

CREDITS:
I started out following this guide: https://www.mooict.com/make-a-clicking-app-using-python-and-tkinter/
Everything else not included in that original script was written by me though.
